### Collision System Enhancements for soldier colliding with zombies, obstacles, hazards
- Update the CollisionSystem
- Enhance soldier collision handling for zombies, obstacles and hazards
- Implement damage area

### Shooting System
- Implement the ShootingSystem
- Create Projectile class for bullets and grenades
- Implement shooting mechanics with cooldown and rate of fire
- Add damage calculation based on weapon quality
- Add lane-based shooting logic based on soldier positions
- Refactor collision-system, damage-system, damage-service for clear responsibilities
- Implement area effects for grenades
- implement sticky grenades
- implement sticky area and slow effect
- implement mechanic to update gun quality

### Bonus System
- Create Bonus entities: Lane bonus and embedded bonus and bonus system and update bonus service
- Implement Soldier, Weapon, Grenade, and StickyGrenade bonuses

### Solve Technical Debts
- Some entities now contain logic methods, incorrect according to ECS framework
- Some entities now contain specific information
- Inconsistent way of using entities or classes
