## Code Organization

### Project Structure
- Follow the established project structure as defined in the architecture document
- Place new files in the appropriate directories based on their functionality
- Maintain separation between core, entity, system, and UI modules

### Module Organization
- Keep modules focused on a single responsibility
- Limit file size to maintain readability (aim for <300 lines per file)
- Group related functionality within appropriate subdirectories
- Use index.js files to expose public APIs from directories

### Import/Export
- Use named exports for better refactoring support
- Avoid circular dependencies between modules
- Keep import statements organized and grouped by type (external libraries, internal modules)
- Minimize dependencies between modules to reduce coupling

## Architecture Patterns

### Entity-Component-System (ECS)
- Keep entities as simple containers for components
- Ensure components store data but no logic
- Implement systems that act on entities with specific components
- Avoid direct communication between systems; use the event bus instead

### Service Locator Pattern
- Register core services through the service locator
- Access services through the locator rather than direct imports
- Create interfaces for services to allow for different implementations
- Use dependency injection in tests to provide mock services

### State Pattern
- Encapsulate state-specific behavior within state classes
- Implement clean transitions between states
- Avoid state-specific code outside of state classes
- Use a state manager to handle state transitions

### Observer Pattern (Event Bus)
- Use the event bus for communication between systems
- Define clear event types and payloads
- Subscribe to only the events needed by each system
- Unsubscribe from events when components are destroyed

## Coding Style

### JavaScript/ES6+ Features
- Use ES6+ features but ensure browser compatibility
- Prefer const over let, and let over var
- Use arrow functions for callbacks and anonymous functions
- Utilize destructuring, spread operators, and template literals for cleaner code
- Implement async/await for asynchronous operations

### Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and method names
- Use PascalCase for class names and constructors
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Choose descriptive names that reflect purpose rather than implementation
- Prefix private methods and properties with underscore (_)

### Formatting
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)
- Limit line length to 80-100 characters
- Use semicolons at the end of statements
- Place opening braces on the same line as the statement
- Add spaces around operators and after commas

### Code Quality
- Keep functions small and focused (aim for <30 lines)
- Limit function parameters (aim for â‰¤3 parameters)
- Avoid deep nesting of conditionals and loops
- Extract complex conditions into named functions or variables
- Return early from functions to avoid nested if statements

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Management
- Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects (bullets, effects)
- Reuse objects to minimize garbage collection
- Avoid creating objects in update loops
- Be cautious with closures that might cause memory leaks

### Rendering Optimization
- Use the canvas efficiently, only redrawing what needs to be updated
- Implement sprite batching for similar entities
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
- Consider using off-screen canvases for complex rendering

### Game Loop
- Implement a fixed time step for physics and game logic
- Separate update and render loops if necessary
- Use deltaTime for time-based movement and animations
- Handle variable frame rates gracefully

### Asset Loading
- Implement asset preloading before game start
- Use sprite sheets to reduce the number of image requests
- Compress and optimize assets for web delivery
- Implement progressive loading for large assets

## Testing

### Unit Testing
- Write unit tests for all systems and core functionality
- Use dependency injection to provide mocks for testing
- Focus on testing pure functions and predictable outcomes
- Aim for high test coverage of critical game systems

### Integration Testing
- Test interactions between systems using the event bus
- Verify that events trigger expected behaviors across systems
- Test the full lifecycle of game entities
- Validate game state transitions

### Playtest Automation
- Create automated playtest scenarios to verify game mechanics
- Test edge cases in enemy spawning, collision detection, etc.
- Automate tests for level completion and game over conditions
- Implement regression tests for fixed bugs

### Test-Driven Development
- Consider writing tests before implementing new features
- Use tests to define expected behavior
- Refactor code with confidence using test coverage
- Run tests automatically as part of the build process

## Documentation

### Code Comments
- Document public APIs with JSDoc comments
- Include parameter types, return values, and descriptions
- Document complex algorithms and non-obvious code
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

### Architecture Documentation
- Update architecture documents when making significant changes
- Document design decisions and trade-offs
- Maintain diagrams of system interactions
- Document performance considerations and optimizations

### README and Setup
- Maintain clear setup instructions for new developers
- Document development environment requirements
- Include build and test procedures
- Provide troubleshooting guides for common issues

## Debugging

### Debug Tools
- Implement a debug mode with:
  - Hitbox visualization
  - FPS counter
  - Entity inspector
  - Event logging
- Add toggleable logging for different subsystems
- Create developer shortcuts for testing scenarios

### Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling and reporting
- Use try/catch blocks for error-prone operations
- Log meaningful error messages
- Gracefully recover from non-critical errors

### Performance Monitoring
- Implement performance monitoring tools
- Track frame rates and identify bottlenecks
- Monitor memory usage
- Create performance test scenarios

## Version Control

### Commit Practices
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused on a single change or feature
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages
- Commit frequently with smaller changes

### Branching Strategy
- Use feature branches for new development
- Create bug fix branches from the appropriate base
- Follow the project's merge request process
- Keep branches up-to-date with the main branch

### Code Reviews
- Review all code before merging to main branches
- Check for adherence to these best practices
- Verify test coverage for new code
- Ensure documentation is updated appropriately

By following these best practices, we can create a robust, maintainable, and high-quality codebase for Zombie Lane Defense. These guidelines should be reviewed and updated periodically as the project evolves.
